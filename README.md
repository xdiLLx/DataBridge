# DataBridge

## About

This is a personal project developed in Delphi, aimed at facilitating data imports into various databases. It uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to ensure clean and maintainable code.

The software enables intuitive mapping and transfer of data between different database systems, including Firebird, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, and SQLServer. This project represents my effort to create a practical tool for managing data imports efficiently while applying best practices in software development.

## Key Features

- Facilitates data imports into multiple databases
- Intuitive interface for mapping and data transfer
- Supports Firebird, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, and SQLServer
- Developed using Delphi, following OOP and MVC principles
- Emphasis on clean code for easy maintenance and readability

## Personal Project

This data import solution is a personal project, reflecting my journey in exploring advanced programming concepts and applying them to real-world challenges. It is an open invitation for anyone interested in data management, Delphi programming, or software architecture to explore, learn, and contribute.
